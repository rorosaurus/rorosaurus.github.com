## About Me

Please see my personal website, [**roryhay.es**](https://roryhay.es/), for more information about me.

I use GitHub to host a number of projects.  Most are experimental; few are useful.

All my public repositories are available on my [GitHub account page](https://github.com/rorosaurus?tab=repositories).
